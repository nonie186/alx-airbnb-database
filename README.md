# Objective: 
Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram based on the database specification.

# Instructions:

Identify all entities (User, Property, Booking, etc.) and their attributes.

Define the relationships between entities (e.g., User to Booking, Property to Booking).

I used dbdiagram.io to create a visual representation of your ER diagram.
